## The Stalker

An exercise on building full-stack apps from scratch, with all the fixings.

It's a React application, consuming a Node.js/Express API backed by a PostgreSQL database.

The _stable_ branch has been deployed to https://react-stalker.herokuapp.com/. The TypeScript version of the application lives in the _stable-ts_ branch.

Routing is a little broken.

As of 2018-11-16, this project is abandoned in favor of a blogging application, [canadian-spy](https://github.com/amcooper/canadian-spy), which has the same goals.
